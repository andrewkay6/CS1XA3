project01_script.sh is the main script file described in the project. It currently accepts both
user input and system input.

2 creates a TODO log that contains all of the lines in the project directory that have the #TODO tag
3 lists the amount of HTML, Javascript, CSS, Python, Haskell, and Bash Script files there are in the project folder
4 prompts the user for a URL and the name for the file (minus the extension)
and it creates a file in the project folder with the HTML code of the
respective website
